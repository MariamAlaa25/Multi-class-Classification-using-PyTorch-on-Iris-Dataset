Objective
------------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to build a binary classification model using a with Keras to predict heart disease based on health indicators from the provided dataset.

Dataset Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
Age: Age of the individual.

Sex: Gender of the individual (often represented as 0 for female and 1 for male).

BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

Smoking: Whether the individual smokes or has a history of smoking (usually binary: 1 for smoker, 0 for non-smoker).

Alcohol Consumption: Whether the individual consumes alcohol regularly.

Physical Activity: Indicator of whether the individual engages in regular physical activity (1 for active, 0 for inactive).

Diet: A measure of the individualâ€™s dietary habits, such as daily fruit/vegetable intake.

Cholesterol: Cholesterol level measurements.

Blood Pressure: Blood pressure levels, often including systolic and diastolic values.

Diabetes: Indicator of whether the individual has diabetes (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).

Heart Disease: Whether the individual has been diagnosed with heart disease (binary outcome: 1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease). (Target column)
